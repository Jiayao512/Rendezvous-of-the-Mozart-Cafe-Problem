### Mozart Cafe problem without a river for n = 4
'''
INPUT:
n: the number of caf√©s.
experiments: the number of trials of the simiulation to perform. In this case, this is 10,000.

OUTPUT:
count: a list in which the number of days to rendezvous are counted for each trial.
This list is used to compute the following:
- average: the average expected meeting time.
- maximum: the maximum number of days it took to rendezvous for this simulation.
- minimum: the minimum number of days it took to rendezvous for this simulation.
